  For our project we are trying to get a mortgage for buying the house and
  renovating it. In Finland it is no problem to get a mortgage for an existing
  building or to build a new one. But it is much more difficult if you want to
  built under an existing roof.

After finding a suitable view with an existing building to renovate we wanted to get the money from the bank for buying and renovating the house.

We contacted Nordea, Dankse Bank, S-Pankki and OP. We also called with Handelsbanken, but they were very difficult on the phone. Expect some hurdles when applying for a loan. Most of the banks work the same way. They try to keep you at a distance with a lot of forms between you and them. Most of them in Finnish.
